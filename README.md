# Hello, I am Sarthak Arora!

---

#### I am a Computer Science PhD aspirant, and my research presently focuses on Remote Sensing Datasets, Climate Change, Ethics and Machine Learning. 

#### I am currently working as a Research Scientist at University of California, Berkeley with Dr. Joshua Dimon. I am also working as a ML Engineer with the AI for Good Foundation on their Climate Trendscanner Project, where I am creating a Climate content modeling pipeline using NLP models such as BERT and LDA. 

#### Prior to this, I was a Researcher at UC Berkeley under Dr. Thomas Azwell, where I modeled wildfire risk in the state of California using AI/ML to understand and preemptively predict the spread of wildfires. 

#### I received my Bachelors degree in Statistics from Ramjas College - Delhi University, and my Masters Degree in Machine Learning from Plaksha University. I have work experience at organizations such as Disney+ Hotstar, Paytm and Nearbuy.

#### Please feel free to reach out to have conversations around Research, Environment, Ethics, Art, Politics or more!
